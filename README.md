### SpaceRocks (Willem)
* **Tutorial:** https://youtu.be/raGK_j1NVdE?list=PLhIbBGhnxj5JcbfoxS_CWTnImRL_wB_Wg
* **Software:** Gamemaker Studio 2
* **Description:** Following the tutorials released by YoYo Games, I made Space Rocks, which is apparently legally distinct enough from Asteroids that Atari hasn't made a fuss. After implementing the game's basic functionality, I continued on through further segments of the tutorial to add additional elements, such as a scrolling camera, a parallax background, and three types of enemies
* **What I learned:** I did not give Gamemaker Studio 2 nearly enough credit. Going into this I was already familiar with Unity. Seeing the differences between the types and appearences of games produced by the two engines, I assumed that Gamemaker Studio would be far simpler. That did not turn out to be the case. The tutorial I followed wasn't what I intended to be the full extent of what I would accomplish, but the effort required to learn the UI, tools, and language associated with Gamemaker were greater than I imagined. This proved something that I thought I already understood: simple appearence =/= simple code.
* **What didn't work:** This is related to the above. I thought that picking up an entirely new game engine complete with its own IDE, language, organizational structure, and tools would be simple. I thought using said engine to make a type of game I've never worked on before would be easy. While the process wasn't an undue burden, I certainly didn't give it enough respect.

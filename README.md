### SpaceRocks (Willem)
* **Tutorial:** https://youtu.be/raGK_j1NVdE?list=PLhIbBGhnxj5JcbfoxS_CWTnImRL_wB_Wg
* **Software:** Gamemaker Studio 2
* **Description:** Following the tutorials released by YoYo Games, I made Space Rocks, which is apparently legally distinct enough from Asteroids that Atari hasn't made a fuss. After implementing the game's basic functionality, I continued on through further segments of the tutorial to add additional elements, such as a scrolling camera, a parallax background, and three types of enemies
* **What I learned:** I did not give Gamemaker Studio 2 nearly enough credit. Going into this I was already familiar with Unity. Seeing the differences between the types and appearences of games produced by the two engines, I assumed that Gamemaker Studio would be far simpler. That did not turn out to be the case. The tutorial I followed wasn't what I intended to be the full extent of what I would accomplish, but the effort required to learn the UI, tools, and language associated with Gamemaker were greater than I imagined. This proved something that I thought I already understood: simple appearence =/= simple code.
* **What didn't work:** This is related to the above. I thought that picking up an entirely new game engine complete with its own IDE, language, organizational structure, and tools would be simple. I thought using said engine to make a type of game I've never worked on before would be easy. While the process wasn't an undue burden, I certainly didn't give it enough respect.

### IsometricDemo (Eitan)
* **Tutorial:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW744Zgc1YY
* **Software:** Unity
* **Description:** We were testing out how to implement more atypical game elements in different environments to see which ones handled them best. I worked on implementing isometric tilemaps in Unity, since my previous experience with platformers was entirely the traditional 2D style. I was interested in exploring certain features such as elevation and objects occupying the same space that would not be possible in the same fashion in 2D.
* **What I learned:** There is apparently a lot of math that goes into how far apart tiles should be, the cell size, and what the Z transparency sort axis value should be. Before paying proper attention to this I had great difficulty keeping objects from being overlaid on each other unintentionally or having them at the wrong elevations. Getting the basics of isometric maps down was the hard part; even though I have good fundamentals in Unity I needed to spend a lot of time working on basic features and getting background parameters right before starting.
* **What didn't work:** Isometric maps in Unity are pretty bad from what I've seen. There are too many workarounds that have to be used and elevation, the most important element in my opinion, works extremely inconsistently.
